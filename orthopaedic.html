        <p id="steps" ><strong>Earn a bachelor's degree</strong></p>
        <img src="steps.jpg" alt="steps" width="500" >
        <p>First, consider earning a bachelor's degree from an accredited university. During your degree path, try to complete coursework in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>General chemistry</li>
            <li>Organic chemistry</li>
            <li>Biology</li>
            <li>Physics</li>
            <li>Mathematics</li>
            <li>English</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also consider taking pre-med classes or apply for an internship and choose science-based electives. On average, it takes about four years to earn a bachelor's degree.</p>
      
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><strong>Pass the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT)</strong></p>
        <p>Next, you appear and pass a seven-hour MCAT test to demonstrate your eligibility for medical school. The MCAT comprises individually scored sections, and the overall score can be between 472 and 528. Potential orthopedic surgeons typically obtain high scores on the MCAT, which focuses on the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chemical and physical foundations of biological systems</li>
            <li>Critical analysis and reasoning skills</li>
            <li>Biological and biochemical foundations of living systems</li>
            <li>Psychological, social and biological foundations of behavior</li>
        </ul>
       
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><strong>Attend medical school</strong></p>
        <p>Once you pass the MCAT, consider applying to medical school. Aspiring orthopedic surgeons typically earn their medical degree to become a doctor of medicine or osteopathic doctor. During the four years of medical school, you commonly study the following courses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anatomy</li>
            <li>Biochemistry</li>
            <li>Physiology</li>
            <li>Genetics</li>
            <li>Pharmacology</li>
            <li>Pathology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You also participate in clinical rotations in standard medical specialties, such as surgery, medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, radiology, psychiatry and neurology.</p>
        
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><strong>Complete residency</strong></p>
        <p>Next, you may spend about five years of on-the-job training during your residency. Students spend the first two or more years in general surgery, then advance to orthopedics during the last few years. During this time, students work alongside attending physicians and gain confidence in their abilities and skills, while learning to build rapport with patients.</p>
      
    </li>


<h2>How to Become an Orthopedic Surgeon (Continued)</h2>


    <li>
        <p><strong>Complete a fellowship</strong></p>
        <p>Most orthopedic surgeons then complete a fellowship that involves an in-depth study of a specific part of the body or a subspecialty. A fellowship generally takes one or two years to complete. During their fellowship, orthopedic surgeons can focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hand, foot, ankle and spine surgery</li>
            <li>Pediatric orthopedics</li>
            <li>Orthopedic oncology</li>
            <li>Reconstructive surgery</li>
            <li>Surgical sports medicine</li>
        </ul>
     
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><strong>Earn your license</strong></p>
        <p>Once you complete all training requirements, you then take and pass the national United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) or the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination (COMLEX). Clearing either of these licensing exams is necessary for you to practice as an orthopedic surgeon. Licensing requirements can vary across states, so consider researching whether your state has additional licensing requirements.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><strong>Earn a board certification</strong></p>
        <p>After you receive your license, passing a board exam to practice isn't a requirement, but it can improve how much patients trust you and confirms your dedication to your profession as a surgeon. Becoming board-certified as an orthopedic surgeon includes passing an inspection from a jury of peers, who then deem you to be competent and knowledgeable in orthopedic surgery.</p>
        <p>The American Board of Orthopedic Surgery (ABOS) and the American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery (AOBOS) administer board exams for orthopedic surgeons. These board exams include 320 multiple-choice, computer-based questions. Following the written portion, surgeons take and pass an oral question-and-answer exam that analyzes their knowledge and expertise in surgical procedures. To remain board certified, orthopedic surgeons participate in continuing education and renew their certification through board evaluation and exams every seven to 10 years. These requirements ensure surgeons stay current with the latest developments and innovations in the field.</p>
