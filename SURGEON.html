    <li id="Steps"><strong>Step 1: Take Related AP Courses in High School</strong>
        <p>Aspiring doctors and surgeons should consider high school AP courses in subjects like chemistry, biology, and physics. High school students who can devote their time and effort to additional AP courses might take AP anatomy or AP physiology, where available. AP courses in these subjects are known to be especially challenging. But, they often prove to be worth it because AP students can opt out of some similar introductory college courses.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Step 2: Earn a Bachelor's Degree</strong>
        <p>Aspiring surgeons must earn a bachelor's degree. These programs emphasize essential skills like discretion, communication, and teamwork. You can enroll in your school’s pre-med program to ensure you take the right credits in the right subjects. If your school does not have a pre-med program, you can still earn the credits you need to qualify for medical school.</p>
        <p>Aspiring surgeons need a bachelor’s degree filled with STEM and English courses. Required courses may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organic chemistry</li>
            <li>Microbiology</li>
            <li>Psychology</li>
            <li>Anatomy and physiology</li>
            <li>English</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because surgeons need so many science courses, many pre-med students major in a scientific field, such as biology, chemistry, or human physiology. You could major in a social science like public health or psychology instead, as long as you fulfill the prerequisite requirements for medical school.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Step 3: Gain Practical Experience in the Healthcare Field</strong>
        <p>No matter your major, you need experience before applying to medical school. Hands-on exposure through internships, shadowing, or volunteering in a healthcare setting is necessary to test-drive your chosen career. Additionally, medical schools only consider applicants as serious if they have practical experience.</p>
        <p>Taking a "gap year" between completing a bachelor's program and starting a medical degree can build personal character and inspire maturity and professionalism. Students should inquire through their bachelor's program about potential medical assisting, critical care, or clinical internship placement after graduation.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Step 4: Pass the MCAT Exam</strong>
        <p>Any student planning to attend medical school must first take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The exam tests the skills of aspiring med students across four core concept areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Biological and biochemical foundations of living systems</li>
            <li>Chemical and physical foundations of biological systems</li>
            <li>Psychological, social, and biological foundations of behavior</li>
            <li>Critical analysis and reasoning skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The MCAT contains 230 multiple-choice questions and takes just over six hours to complete. Students should take the MCAT in the calendar year before the year they plan to apply to medical school.</p>
        <p>The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) administers the test from January through September. AAMC also offers MCAT prep books and MCAT prep courses.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Step 5: Earn a Medical Degree</strong>
        <p>Once students have taken the MCAT, they can apply to medical school. Medical degree programs take four years. They train students in broad medical skills, introduce them to a variety of specialties through clinical rotations in their third year, and help students gain hands-on experience in their desired specialty.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First and Second Year:</strong> Students spend the first two years focusing on labs and pre-clinical training in subjects such as microbiology, biochemistry, anatomy, pharmacology, and pathology.</li>
            <li><strong>Third Year:</strong> According to the American College of Physicians, during the third year, students transition from the classroom to clinical training. They have a schedule of rotations in various specialties and work alongside other healthcare providers as members of a patient care team. Attending physicians supervise the students as they gain hands-on experience in a variety of specialties and patient populations. Most programs recommend, but do not require, students take their rotations in a certain order. Students may have some flexibility with their rotations based on their interests, needs, and other responsibilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Fourth Year:</strong> The fourth year is typically less structured and provides more opportunity for students to hone their skills and take additional elective coursework. This is also when they choose their specialty and apply to residency programs through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). On Match Day each year in March, students learn where they will start their residency training.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Step 6: Prepare for Medical Licensure</strong>
        <p>The next step in becoming a surgeon is attaining your medical license. While licensure is listed as Step 6 of this guide, the process actually begins while you're still in medical school.</p>
        <p>Medical students often take Step 1 of the exam(s) when they begin their clinical rotations, sitting for the exam the summer between their second and third years of med school.</p>
        <p><strong>Each state has its own rules for licensure, but many have a limited medical license that residency students can apply for directly after getting their residency match. This limited license allows practice under supervision.</strong></p>
        <p>While you're not expected to have your medical license when your residency starts, you'll need one by the time you conclude the residency.</p>
        <p>Once you know your residency match, your program may have a licensure path to share with you. The two most common licensing exam pathways often look like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MD students take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), and DO students take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination (COMLEX).</li>
            <li>Both licensing exams are composed of three steps:</li>
            <ul>
                <li

                o1>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Typically occurs during the second year of medical school and covers the fundamental science for the practice of medicine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Occurs during the third or fourth year and is more specific to clinical skills and clinical knowledge gained during rotations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> More comprehensive and detailed in the practice of medicine. Students complete it in the first or second year of residency — after they have graduated from medical school.</li>
                    <li><strong>Both the USMLE and COMLEX:</strong> Are similar in structure. However, the COMLEX also includes osteopathic manipulation questions.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>The USMLE fees:</strong> Step 1 - $1,000, Step 2 - $1,000, Step 3 - $925 *</p>
                <p><strong>The COMLEX:</strong> $715 per exam according to the NBOME (National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners).</p>
                <p>You can take each step a limited number of times. For instance, if you have attempted a step four or more times and do not pass, you are ineligible to apply for any other steps in the USMLE sequence.</p>
                <p>You must pass Step 3 before applying to any State Medical Board.</p>
                <p>* There will be extra steps and fees if you're a graduate of a medical school outside the United States.</p>
                
                <h2>Step 7: Complete a Residency Program</h2>
                <p>Most surgeons complete a general surgery residency after they finish medical school. In the U.S. some specialties, like obstetrics, start their surgical residency in their specialty.</p>
                <p>To get into a surgical residency program — the Match Day mentioned above — you’ll participate in an algorithm-like process that matches you to a residency program.</p>
                <p>Most students begin applying to residencies in their final year of medical school, but the American Colleges of Surgeons recommends you familiarize yourself and start some steps of the process in your third year.</p>
                <p>Accredited surgical residency programs cannot require residents to work more than 80 hours a week. However, programs in surgical specialties can apply for an extension to increase the weekly limit to 88 hours per week.</p>
                <p>Surgical residencies can be more taxing than other types of clinical experiences. A residency helps surgeons refine their acute operating skills and on-the-spot decision-making abilities. Surgical residencies last a minimum of five years, unless you go into dental or eye surgery.</p>
                
                <h2>Step 8: Begin a Fellowship Program</h2>
                <p>A fellowship helps surgeons gain experience in their chosen surgical specialty. Hospitals offer fellowships in surgical specialties like orthopedic, plastic, cardiothoracic, and neurological surgery.</p>
                <p>Fellows have already passed the USMLE or COMLEX and received a medical license. They tend to earn more than surgical residents. Fellowships can last for one to three years.</p>
                <p>Candidates must have completed a residency training program approved by the Residency Review Committee and accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Candidates can apply directly to some colleges or search for fellowships through an agency like the Fellowship Council.</p>
                
                <h2>Step 9: Become Board Certified in Your Surgical Specialty</h2>
                <p>While surgeons may be able to get a job as a board-eligible surgeon, most reputable employers require surgeons to become board certified in a timely manner after they finish residency.</p>
                <p>Board certification demonstrates a surgeon's commitment to professionalism, lifelong learning, and quality care.</p>
                <p>Board certification is different from earning a medical license. Board certification is specialty-specific and not required by law, but medical licenses are a general requirement to legally practice medicine across specialties.</p>
                <p>According to the American College of Surgeons, board certification is regulated by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and includes 24 medical and surgical specialty boards.</p>
                <p>The ABMS sets the eligibility criteria that physicians must meet to take certifying examinations in their specialty. To qualify, surgeons must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be graduates of an accredited medical school or have a certificate from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates.</li>
                    <li>Complete about five years of residency in their specialty from a program approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.</li>
                    <li>Acquire extensive operative experience and a vast knowledge of disease management within their specialty.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When applying, surgeons must provide detailed documentation of their training and operative experience. Additionally, the director of their training program must also attest to their surgical skills, ethics, and professionalism. If the application is approved, the surgeon may take the required exam for certification for their board.</p>
