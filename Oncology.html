    <p>Oncologists are doctors who specialize in treating and caring for patients suffering from various cancers. They apply their medical knowledge to make individual assessments and implement personalized treatment plans while using their interpersonal skills to offer support to patients. If you're interested in becoming an oncologist, it can be helpful to learn the typical requirements, skills, and salary of the profession to determine if it's the right match for you.</p>

    <p>In this article, we define what an oncologist is, explain how to become one, discuss their skills, and provide their average salary and career outlook.</p>

    <h2>What is an oncologist?</h2>
    
    <p>An oncologist is a doctor who specializes in cancer treatment. They diagnose and treat cancer, assess treatment progress, and provide follow-up care for patients with different cancers. Oncologists can also work in a sub-specialty, where they focus on treating cancers in certain clinical populations or in specific areas of the body.</p>

    <p>For example, oncologists may specialize in pediatrics, geriatrics, neurology, or hematology. While most types of oncologists follow similar pathways for completing their training and education, those working in certain specialties may pursue additional training and certification. Knowing what type of oncologist you want to become can help you plan your career path.</p>

    

    <h2>Types of oncologists</h2>

    <p>Within the field of oncology, there are several areas of practice based on different treatment methods. These areas include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Medical oncology: This type of oncologist treats cancer using medications like chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. Oncologists who use this type of treatment often combine it with other approaches.</li>
        <li>Radiation oncology: A radiation oncologist is a physician who focuses on using radiation therapy to treat cancer. Radiation therapy relies on the use of high-energy radiation waves to destroy cancer cells.</li>
        <li>Surgical oncology: Surgical oncologists perform surgical procedures to collect tissue samples and remove cancerous tumors from the body. These physicians may perform biopsies that allow them to diagnose cancer based on collected...</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="how.jpg" alt="how" width="500" >
    <h2 id="how-to">Here are the steps for how to start a career as an oncologist:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Earn a bachelor's degree</strong></li>
        <p>The first step toward becoming an oncologist is to earn a bachelor's degree. This typically takes four years on average to complete. Earning your undergraduate degree in biology, chemistry, pre-medicine, kinesiology, or another related scientific field allows you to gain a foundation of knowledge in the natural sciences that can help you in medical school. Some coursework you might complete as part of your program may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Biology</li>
            <li>Chemistry</li>
            <li>Anatomy and physiology</li>
            <li>Public health</li>
            <li>Aging and development across the lifespan</li>
            <li>Calculus</li>
            <li>Health policy and management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consider finding opportunities to gain relevant work experience while pursuing your degree. Having experience working or volunteering in the medical field can help your application stand out from others when you apply for medical school. For example, volunteering at a hospital, cancer center, rehabilitation facility, or cancer support service organization can be helpful for getting involved while making a difference in your community. These experiences help you gain practical skills while learning about the industry. It can also be an effective way to network with professionals who are already established in the field.</p>
        

        <li><strong>Pursue medical school</strong></li>
    <p>After finishing your undergraduate education, start applying to medical schools. Earning admission into medical school can be challenging, so if you don't get accepted immediately, be persistent and continue applying each year. Completing medical school takes four years on average. It usually involves a period of classroom study followed by practical clinical training. During this training, you rotate between clinical specialties to learn skills related to different areas of medical practice. This training can help you decide what area of medicine you want to practice as a licensed physician.</p>
    >
    
        <li><strong>Earn your medical license</strong></li>
        <p>Once you graduate from medical school, you can take the medical licensing exam to earn your provisional practice license. This level of licensure qualifies you to work in a clinical setting under the supervision of an experienced physician. Before you can participate in a residency program, you need to have a license to practice medicine, which you can only earn by passing an exam. The exam comprises three parts, and you complete one part each day, answering multiple-choice questions related to different areas of medical practice, such as clinical skills, scientific knowledge, and patient management.</p>

        <li><strong>Complete your training and residency</strong></li>
        <p>Depending on what kind of oncologist you want to become, you may follow a different training and residency path. For example, if you plan to work in neurology, you need to complete a year-long internship before starting a residency program. This internship trains candidates for surgery and internal medicine to prepare them for residency work within their specialty. If you don't plan to become a neurologist, you can immediately enter a residency program within your chosen oncology specialty. These programs take two to five years to complete, depending on your area of practice.</p>

        <li><strong>Complete a fellowship</strong></li>
        <p>Some types of oncologists may also pursue fellowship training after their residency program. Fellowships are training for those looking to work in a highly specialized clinical sub-specialty. For example, if you want to work in pediatrics, you may need to continue your training by participating in a fellowship program. A fellowship in pediatric oncology helps you gain the skills you need to diagnose and treat cancers in infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, who may have different medical needs from the general adult population.</p>
        
    
    
        <li><strong>Become certified in your state</strong></li>
        <p>Finally, after completing your training requirements, consider applying for board certification. Being a board-certified oncologist shows you meet a high standard of professional excellence. Although not required, having this certification can improve your candidacy when applying for oncology jobs or gaining new patients if you own a private clinic. To become board certified in oncology, you can pass the certification exam offered through the American Board of Internal Medicine. Before taking the exam, you need to meet certain requirements, like completing residency and fellowship training, having an unrestricted medical license, and showing professional competence through experience.</p>
